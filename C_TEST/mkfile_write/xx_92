I threw a wish in the well
Don’t ask me I’ll never tell
I looked to you as it fell
and now you’re in my way
I’d trade my soul for a wish
Pennies and dimes – for a kiss
I wasn’t looking for this
But now you’re in my way
Your stare was holding
Ripped jeans – skin was showing
Hot night – Wind was blowing
Where d’ you think you’re going baby?
Hey I just met you
and this is crazy
But here’s my number
So, Call Me Maybe
It’s hard to look right
at you baby!
But here’s my number
So, Call Me Maybe
Hey I just met you
and this is crazy
But here’s my number
So, Call Me Maybe
and all the other boys
try to chase me
But here’s my number
So, Call Me Maybe
